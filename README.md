# Autonomous Robot Navigation

# Python ver. 3.10.6
# RoboticsToolBox ver. 0.10.0

# Goals Of Code:
a) Allow user input to initialise the robot’s start and target coordinates, as well as loading a
generated map to be navigated autonomously.
b) Calculate and continue to update the position of the robot within the map using
simulated robot encoders and distance sensors.
c) Define the logic required to reach the target as fast as possible without any collision with
the walls using sensory feedback.
d) Display a plot showing the robot, map, target, and any additional useful outputs, in order
to visualise the robot’s locomotion towards its target.
